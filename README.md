# Deep Synthesis
A deep learning framework for predicting chemical synthesis

## Local Setup

Follow these instructions to set up Deep Synthesis on your local machine

Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/kheyer/Deep-Synthesis`

Run `buildEnv.sh`. This shell script will create a conda environment named `deep_synthesis`, install all required packages and download the trained model

`cd Deep-Synthesis`

`chmod +x buildEnv.sh`

`./buildEnv.sh`

Follow the package installation prompts.

Once package installation is complete, activate the new conda environment and start the Streamlit app

`source activate deep_synthesis`

`streamlit run Synthesis/app.py`

The Streamlit app is now running locally on port 8501
